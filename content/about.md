Datavore Consulting was a short-lived business venture by [Travis Hinkelman](https://www.travishinkelman.com) and [Ben Nolting](http://www.bennolting.org/). We both long ago moved on to new opportunities, but we have maintained this site to host our blog posts for posterity.

Sadly, Ben succumbed to a chronic illness on August 2, 2020.
