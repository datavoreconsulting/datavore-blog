<p>This post is a quick tip on how to use the <code>paste</code><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> function to read and write multiple files. First, let’s create some data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dataset = data.frame(expand.grid(Trt=c(rep(&quot;Low&quot;,10),rep(&quot;High&quot;,10)),
                                 Sex=c(rep(&quot;Male&quot;,10),rep(&quot;Female&quot;,10))),
                     Response=rnorm(400))</code></pre>
<p>The next step is not necessary, but makes the subsequent code more readable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>trt = levels(dataset$Trt)
sex = levels(dataset$Sex)</code></pre>
<p>The following example is silly because you would rarely want to split your data as shown in this example, but (hopefully) it clearly illustrates the general idea of using <code>paste</code> to create dynamic file names when writing files.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:length(trt)){
    for (j in 1:length(sex)){
        write.csv(subset(dataset, Trt==trt[i] &amp; Sex==sex[j]), 
                  paste(trt[i],sex[j],&quot;.csv&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;), 
                  row.names=FALSE)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The result of this loop is four CSV files: <code>HighFemale.csv</code>, <code>HighMale.csv</code>, <code>LowFemale.csv</code>, and <code>LowMale.csv</code>. We can use the same basic idea to read those same four files into a single data frame. The key is to initialize an empty data frame and then append, via <code>rbind</code>, the data from each of the four files.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>dataset2 = data.frame()
for (i in 1:length(trt)){
    for (j in 1:length(sex)){
        dataset2 = rbind(dataset2, 
                         read.csv(paste(trt[i],sex[j],&quot;.csv&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;)))
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I found this approach useful when I used a supercomputer to conduct many, many runs of an agent-based model. My jobs were queued more quickly on the supercomputer if they were small, so I broke my simulation experiments into many small jobs. This produced many files that I needed to combine into one data frame for analysis in R.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I subsequently learned that <code>file.path</code> is the recommended approach for this task because it constructs the path “in a platform-independent way.”<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Now, I generally start with an empty <code>list</code> and fill that list with the data frames before using <code>rbind</code> or, more usually, <code>dplyr::bind_rows</code> on the list.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
