<p>A quick break from my usual <a href="/categories/r/">R-centric posts</a> to toot the horn of one of my other favorite pieces of freeware, <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml">NetLogo</a>, which “is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment.” If you are interested in modeling complex systems and spatially-explicit behavior or processes, you should definitely take the time to (at least) <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml">download NetLogo</a> and browse a few of the many <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/">example models</a>. NetLogo has a relatively shallow learning curve and a supportive <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/netlogo-users">community</a> that fields questions from beginners without the snark that you find in many other help forums.</p>
<p>NetLogo suffers from the misconception that it is <a href="http://agentbasedmodeling.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/divingintoabms/">not a serious research tool</a> and is only useful as a teaching tool or as a platform for quickly building model prototypes. The GUI elements, extensive models library, and emphasis on teaching applications undoubtedly fuel the misconception. However, NetLogo performs well in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0037549706073695">comparisons</a> with other platforms for building agent-based models. The GUI elements often simplify model development, but you can run also your model headless to improve model performance. I used NetLogo to build a model of animal movement and ran my simulation experiments on a supercomputer, which greatly reduced the computational limitations inherent in running lots of simulations.</p>
<p>You can link NetLogo to <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/mathematica.html">Mathematica</a> and <a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/15/3/8.html">R</a> to take advantage of the capabilities of Mathematica and R for analyzing the results of your NetLogo model without “the cumbersome transfer of data via file output and input.” You can also call R functions from within your NetLogo model to, for example, generate random deviates from distributions not included in NetLogo’s <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html">primitives</a>. Calling R from within NetLogo carries a speed cost, though. The decision to call R functions from NetLogo therefore involves a trade-off between model execution speed and model development time because of the time to required to write equivalent code in NetLogo.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there are R packages (e.g., <a href="http://simecol.r-forge.r-project.org/">simecol</a>) that facilitate building agent-based models in R, but I have not tried them. Because NetLogo is a high-level language specifically designed for building agent-based models, I would expect model development to proceed much more quickly in NetLogo than R (even if you factor in the learning curve for NetLogo). I would love to hear from someone who has developed agent-based models in both NetLogo and R to provide an informed comparison.</p>
