<p>I love the elegant simplicity of programming in Mathematica. There is something undeniably beautiful about accomplishing something complex in a concise chunk of code. A famous Mathematica mantra is, “if you are using a For loop, you are probably doing it wrong.” I encourage Mathematica programmers to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>To illustrate the efficiency of Mathematica code, I’d like to draw your attention to the recent results of <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/09/20/mathematica-experts-live-one-liner-competition-and-the-winners-are/">Wolfram’s “One-Liner Competition”</a>. Each program in the competition is 140 characters or less. Yes, that’s right… tweetable programs. You can watch screencasts of the winner and honorable mentions <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?channel=282">here</a>.</p>
<p>For those who work in biological modelling, I recommend checking <a href="http://www.ifb.uni-stuttgart.de/mitarbeiter?id=35">Yves Klett’s</a> entry. It gives a new meaning to the old modelling punchline “assume all cows are spheres”.</p>
