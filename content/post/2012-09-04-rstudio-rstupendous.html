<p>I am a sucker for beautiful applications. The latest R-related application to catch my eye is <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RStudio™ is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can run it on your desktop (Windows, Mac, or Linux) or even over the web using RStudio Server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may find RStudio described as a GUI for R (see <a href="http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20110306113701179/GUIsforR.html">here</a>), but that refers to the GUI elements present in RStudio that facilitate code development. If you want to use R without writing code, you have a few options, such as <a href="http://www.deducer.org/">Deducer</a> and <a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/">R Commander</a>, but to exploit the full power of R you will eventually need to learn how to write code.</p>
<p>I hadn’t previously sought out a text editor (or IDE) for R because I was satisfied with the features of the built-in editor for R on Mac OS X. As such, my enthusiasm for RStudio is not based on a comparison to alternatives such as <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/">Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS)</a>. But the beauty, cross-platform compatibility, and generally favorable reviews of RStudio made it the top candidate to take for a test drive.</p>
<p>I will not duplicate the efforts of previous bloggers (see <a href="http://www.bytemining.com/2011/03/my-first-few-days-with-rstudio/">here</a> and <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/03/rstudio_first_impression/">here</a>) by providing an overview of RStudio’s best features, but I particularly love the integration with the wonderful R package <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> for dynamic report generation in LaTeX, HTML, Markdown, and more. I first started using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to typeset my dissertation, became smitten, and vowed to never use Word again (an overzealous oath). However, I only recently created my first dynamic report using knitr and LaTeX. I anticipate that my exploration of knitr, facilitated by RStudio, will spawn several future blog posts, partly because it allows me to continue to beat the drum for <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html">reproducible research</a>. Lastly, if you are using R on Windows through the built-in editor, then you are missing out on a number of wonderful features to improve your workflow and you should download RStudio immediately.</p>
